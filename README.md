# UI Engineer Coding Exercise

## Instructions

To complete this test, we are expecting
you to accurately make this responsive
design.

The page consists of 9 numbered cards
which can be manipulated by using the
shuffle and short buttons.

Using JavaScript, allow the user to:

- Click the shuffle button to randomly
rearrange the order of the cards
- Click the sort button to place the
cards in ascending order (1 â€“ 9)

Take no more than 60-90 minutes for
this test. Please try this without using any
frameworks or libraries. Your code will be
tested in Chrome.

Colours used in this design:
`#000000 #2B8EAD #333333 #6F98A8 #FFFFFF #BFBFBF #EFEFEF #2F454E #72C3DC`

## Coding Comments

- The requested UI used ECMAScript (JavaScript ES6) and HTML5
- The Fisher-Yates shuffle algorithm was converted to ES6 and was found [here](http://sedition.com/perl/javascript-fy.html)
- CSS utilised the CSS Grid format since the insrtuctions do not require support for the IE11
- The mobile view is triggered only for devices of 375px or lower as per intructions
- The desktop view has a maimum width of 960px as it was understood by the provided mockup
